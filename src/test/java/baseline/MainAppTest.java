// yup, i forgot the tests, but they're here now
// its been a long week, what can i say? ...but we're here now
// lots of stuff to do and classes are cracking down

// i did all of the other parts of the assignment,
// but of course the easiest part slipped my mind
// as every other thing was also falling apart

// sorry for the lateness and possibly oversharing, i just wanted to give a peek into my week
